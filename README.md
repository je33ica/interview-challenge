### Further Developments

Implement filter - is filtering correctly in the console but needs to be refactored into code

Dietary display - not completed 

refactor code to useContext instead of prop drilling ( I have never used it before but I know its a cleaner solution )

Tooltip for dietary requirements - easy to know what the abbreviations mean 

Calorie display- can be toggled, always off so not impact any mental health 

separate items into areas - savoury/ sweet?  / colour code / easy to distinguish- increase basket spend, add on eg a chocolate bar don't get lost in list
